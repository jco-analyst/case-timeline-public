## FILTER 1: FAMILY STATUS DISCRIMINATION ⭐ STRONGEST CLAIM

### Purpose
**Primary claim** - Demonstrates systematic family status discrimination from accommodation → withdrawal → termination 12 days after protected parental leave.

### Legal Theory
**Moore Test (Alberta):**
1. Protected characteristic: Parent with childcare obligations
2. Adverse impact: Discipline, denial of accommodation, termination
3. Causal connection: Protected ground was factor in termination

**Burden Shift:** Once prima facie case established (easy), burden shifts to employer to prove:
- Accommodation would cause undue hardship (FAILS - employer accommodated for 9 months)
- Conducted undue hardship analysis (NONE)

### Event Count: 21 Events

**Foundation (4 events):**
- Jan 10, 2024: First interview - "family means everything to me" (employer knowledge from day 1)
- Oct 9, 2024: Baby born (protected ground established)
- Oct 15, 2024 - Jul 20, 2025: 9-MONTH ACCOMMODATION (range event) - "Being late is okay, just let me know"
- Jul 28, 2025: Parental leave request - "as wife transitions back to full time work" (employer knew ongoing obligations)

**Accommodation Pattern (3 events):**
- Jun 4: Child medical appointment APPROVED
- Jun 13: Sick child care APPROVED
- Jun 25: GPS proves arrived EARLY despite traffic warning (over-communication, good faith)

**⭐ SMOKING GUNS (5 events):**
1. **Jul 20:** "Family Doesn't Matter" statement (explicit rejection of family obligations during "crunch time")
2. **Aug 1:** Michelle Sherman "I don't care" statement (Head of HR rejects family status)
3. **Aug 28:** Sick baby accommodation DENIED (compare to Jun 13 approval)
4. **Oct 10:** Write-Up #4 same day as parental leave return (33-day delay from Sept 7 "urgent" email)
5. **Oct 20:** Schedule accommodation denied, employee complied, terminated anyway

**Parental Leave Retaliation (4 events):**
- Sept 4-Oct 9: Parental leave period (5 weeks, protected activity)
- Sept 7: Michelle "urgent" email (false urgency - waited 33 days to discipline)
- Oct 10: Return + Write-Up #4 same day
- Oct 10: Return + family-related lateness (separate from write-up)

**Pattern Evidence (5 events):**
- Apr 30, May 23, May 29: Proactive lateness notifications (childcare-related)
- Jun 18: Missed alarm - sleep deprivation (dual-tagged: disability + family overlap)
- Jul 31: 24 min late (Day 18 of marathon, exhaustion from employer's 18-day demand)

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Accommodation Withdrawal Pattern:**
- **Oct 2024 - Jul 20, 2025:** Employer accommodated for 9 months → PROVES no undue hardship
- **Jul 21, 2025 onwards:** ALL accommodation denied (Aug 28 sick baby, Oct 20 schedule)
- **Turning Point:** July 20 Sunday overtime refusal → "We need to have a major talk tomorrow"

**2. 12-Day Post-Parental-Leave Termination:**
- Sept 4 - Oct 9: Protected parental leave (5 weeks)
- Oct 10: Write-Up #4 issued SAME DAY as return (33-day delay proves pretext)
- Oct 22: Terminated 12 days after return = **presumption of discrimination**

**3. Institutional Discrimination:**
- Boss: "Family doesn't matter during crunch time"
- HR (Michelle Sherman): "I don't care" about family obligations
- Both supervisor AND Head of HR rejected protected ground = institutional

**4. Tax Advantage:**
- Human rights damages NON-TAXABLE
- $30k award = ~$37k pre-tax equivalent
- Significant settlement pressure point

### Settlement Value: $25k-$40k (non-taxable)
**Most Likely:** $30k-$35k

---

## FILTER 2: DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ⭐ STRONG SECONDARY CLAIM

### Purpose
**Secondary claim** - Two disclosed disabilities (ADHD + sleep apnea), boss has SAME conditions, zero accommodations offered, disciplined for disability symptoms.

### Legal Theory
**Duty to Accommodate:**
1. Disability: ADHD (known Jan 2024) + Sleep apnea (known Feb 18, 2025)
2. Employer knowledge: Pre-employment disclosure + doctor's letters provided
3. Zero accommodations: Despite boss having SAME disabilities and managing them
4. Disciplined for symptoms: Timecard struggles (ADHD executive function), lateness (sleep apnea)

**Undue Hardship Defense FAILS:**
- Boss has ADHD → promoted to position without timecard requirements = accommodation exists
- Boss has sleep apnea → manages with CPAP, no termination = accommodation possible
- Cannot claim undue hardship when boss accommodated for same conditions

### Event Count: 8 Events

**⭐ Disclosure & Knowledge (2 events with stars):**
1. **Jan 15, 2024:** ⭐ ADHD Disclosed - Pre-employment drug test (Vyvanse), doctor's note provided
2. **Feb 18, 2025:** ⭐ Sleep Apnea Diagnosed - Doctor's letter, CPAP prescribed, boss has same condition

**Timecard System Failures (3 events):**
- Jan 8, 2025: Write-Up #2 - First timecard discipline (ADHD executive function challenges)
- Jul 4 - Aug 25: Timecard reminder pattern (4 reminders in 52 days - boss's late unlocking)
- Oct 20: ⭐ Timecard unlock CATCH-22 (boss controlled remedy, created "continued failure" pattern)

**Sleep Apnea Symptoms (3 events):**
- Jun 18: Missed alarm - sleep deprivation (dual-tagged: disability + family)
- Aug 26: Woke up late (sleep apnea symptom, 2 days before sick baby denial)
- Oct 22: Phone died - no alarm (termination incident, technical failure + disability)

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Boss Comparison:**
- Boss has ADHD: Promoted to role avoiding timecard requirements = accommodation
- Boss has sleep apnea: Uses CPAP, manages condition, never terminated = accommodation
- Employee has both: Zero accommodations, fired = differential treatment

**2. Medication Crash Effect:**
- Vyvanse wears off after 6-7 hours (documented medical fact)
- Employer required timecards AFTER work shift (during crash when employee physically unable to focus)
- Boss knew about ADHD + medication crash ("I understand the struggles")
- NO ACCOMMODATION: Flexible timecard submission, reminders, grace period

**3. Sleep Apnea Impact:**
- Moderate sleep apnea = difficulty waking to alarms, disrupted sleep, chronic fatigue
- ALL 13 lateness incidents occurred AFTER employer knew about diagnosis (Feb 18, 2025)
- Oct 22 termination: Phone died (no alarm) + sleep apnea = perfect storm
- Boss has sleep apnea, uses CPAP, manages it successfully = proves accommodation possible

**4. System Manipulation:**
- Oct 20 timecard unlock Catch-22: Boss controlled unlock, delayed it, then cited "continued failure"
- Employee cannot submit timecard when system locked
- Boss's delays created the "pattern" used to justify termination

### Settlement Value: $25k-$50k (non-taxable)
**Most Likely:** $15k-$25k (secondary to family status, but strengthens overall case)

---

## FILTER 3: JUST CAUSE FAILURE (FOUNDATION CLAIM)

### Purpose
**Foundation claim** - Establishes employer FAILED to meet "just cause" threshold (McKinley), proving wrongful dismissal entitles employee to reasonable notice damages.

### Legal Theory
**McKinley v. BC Tel:**
- Just cause = "capital punishment" of employment relationship
- Employer must prove misconduct SO SEVERE it destroyed trust irrevocably
- Requires: Proportionality, progressive discipline, clear warnings, investigation

**Employer FAILS All Thresholds:**
1. **Pretextual discipline:** Write-Up #1 OHS retaliation, Write-Up #3 cited APPROVED accommodations
2. **Differential treatment:** Boss + coworkers exhibit same behavior without consequences
3. **No proportionality:** Same-day termination without investigation for one-time technical failure
4. **Condonation:** 9-month accommodation proves employer tolerated behavior

### Event Count: 17 Events

**Progressive Discipline Breakdown (1 event):**
- Oct 15, 2024: Write-Up #1 - Hydraulic headphones (OHS retaliation, pretextual)

**⭐ Differential Treatment - Boss Lateness (7 events):**
- May 16: Boss missing meeting
- May 28: Boss late
- Jul 10: Boss missing meeting (Marathon Day 1)
- Jul 22: Boss late (Marathon Day 9)
- Jul 27: Boss late (Marathon Day 14)
- Aug 9: Boss late on Saturday
- **Summary event:** Boss lateness pattern (6 instances, no discipline)

**⭐ Differential Treatment - Coworkers (2 events):**
- Oct 16: RJ and Ramon late (no discipline)
- Oct 22: ⭐ **RJ late SAME DAY as employee termination** (no discipline = smoking gun)

**⭐ Differential Treatment - Sick Notes (3 events):**
- Oct 14: Employee required sick note
- Oct 16: Employee still required sick note
- Oct 17: ⭐ Jessica NOT required sick note (same week, same workplace)

**Pretextual Discipline (2 events):**
- Apr 1: Meeting time changed 7:30 AM (eliminated buffer, created MORE discipline opportunities)
- Oct 20: ⭐ Timecard unlock Catch-22 (boss controlled remedy, manufactured "continued failure")

**⭐ Termination Incidents (2 events):**
- Oct 22: Final lateness - phone died (one-time technical failure, NOT willful misconduct)
- Oct 22: ⭐ TERMINATION - Ambush meeting (under 2 minutes, no investigation, zero procedural fairness)

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Differential Treatment Destroys Just Cause:**
- **Boss:** Late 6+ times (May 16, May 28, Jul 10, 22, 27, Aug 9) → No discipline
- **RJ:** Late SAME DAY as employee termination (Oct 22) → No discipline
- **Jessica:** Sick, sent home, NO sick note required (Oct 17) → No discipline
- **Employee:** Same behavior → Terminated for cause
- **Legal Impact:** Inconsistent enforcement = employer cannot meet just cause threshold

**2. Pretextual Discipline:**
- Write-Up #1: OHS retaliation disguised as "headphones" discipline
- Write-Up #3: Cited APPROVED accommodations (Jun 4, Jun 13) as misconduct
- If first write-up invalid → entire progressive discipline chain collapses

**3. Same-Day Termination = Procedural Failure:**
- Oct 22, 8:00 AM: Employee late (phone died - technical failure)
- Oct 22, lunch: TERMINATED (4-5 hours later)
- No investigation of circumstances
- No opportunity to explain
- No warning THIS lateness would be final
- Ambush meeting under 2 minutes

**4. Condonation:**
- Oct 15, 2024 - Jul 20, 2025: Employer accommodated childcare-related lateness for 9 months
- 9-month accommodation = employer tolerated behavior
- Cannot resurrect condoned conduct as just cause

### Settlement Value: $10k-$15k (reasonable notice: 2-3 months)
**If Contract Void ("Dear Rollins:" error):** +$10k-$20k (common law notice 4-6 months instead of ESC minimum)

---

## FILTER 4: BAD FAITH CONDUCT (WALLACE DAMAGES)

### Purpose
Demonstrates employer's unfair, intimidating, untruthful conduct during employment and dismissal, warranting Honda v. Keays moral/aggravated damages.

### Legal Theory
**Honda v. Keays (2008):**
- Moral damages for MANNER of dismissal (separate from reasonable notice)
- Must prove: Bad faith conduct + caused actual harm (medical/financial impact)
- Categories: Intimidation, fabrication, unfair process, evidence destruction

### Event Count: 10 Events

**⭐ Intimidation (3 events with stars):**
- Oct 1, 2024: Confined space safety meeting - sent home for advocacy
- **Jan 8, 2025:** ⭐ Boss's wage theft story (illegal conduct used as threat)
- Apr 1: Meeting time manipulation (created discipline opportunities)

**Fabricated/Pretextual Discipline (3 events):**
- Oct 15, 2024: Write-Up #1 - OHS retaliation disguised as discipline
- Aug 1: Michelle Sherman discriminatory statement (also on family status filter)
- Aug 4: Personal day denied - boss lied about available days

**⭐ Unfair Termination Process (2 events with stars):**
- Jul 14-31: Overtime marathon (18 days, created exhaustion they disciplined for)
- **Oct 22:** ⭐ TERMINATION - Ambush meeting (under 2 minutes, no investigation)

**⭐ Evidence Spoliation (2 events with stars):**
- **Oct 22:** ⭐ Evidence spoliation (email access cut DURING active document review)
- Oct 27: Final pay wrong bank account (financial bad faith)

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Pattern of Intimidation:**
- Wage theft story: Boss bragged about illegal wage theft to intimidate employee about timecard compliance
- Sent home from safety meeting: Public humiliation for raising legitimate concerns
- 10+ "last chance" threats: Created coercive environment, learned helplessness

**2. Fabricated Grounds:**
- Write-Up #3 cited APPROVED accommodations as misconduct (Aug 1)
- Personal day denial with false claim days were used up (Aug 4 - boss lied)
- Just cause allegations employer cannot prove

**3. Ambush Termination:**
- Under 2 minutes total duration
- "You know what this is" - no explanation
- No opportunity to respond
- Decision pre-made (letter already prepared)
- Supervised exit creating stress

**4. Evidence Spoliation:**
- Email access cut while employee actively reviewing documents
- Timecard portal emails destroyed (would prove boss's late unlocking pattern)
- Consciousness of wrongdoing (destroyed evidence harmful to employer)

### Settlement Value: $5k-$20k (aggravated/moral damages)
**Most Likely:** $10k-$15k (strong evidence of bad faith conduct)

---

## FILTER 5: POST-TERMINATION MISCONDUCT (PUNITIVE DAMAGES)

### Purpose
Employer's bad faith AFTER termination supports punitive damages - ROE violations, document tampering, financial misconduct.

### Legal Theory
**Punitive Damages:**
- Awarded when employer conduct so egregious it warrants punishment beyond compensation
- Recent Alberta case (2024 ONSC 3452): **$10k punitive damages for ROE delay alone**
- Federal ROE requirement: 5 days from interruption
- Document integrity violations support spoliation claims

### Event Count: 13 Events

**⭐ ROE Violations (4 events with stars):**
- **Sept 11:** ⭐ CATASTROPHIC ROE ERROR (95%+ error rate - 8 months wrong start date, would destroy EI claim)
- Sept 19: Corrected ROE (8-day delay, still has errors on start date)
- Nov 4: ⭐ Michelle ROE email - federal violation (13 days after termination = 8-day violation)
- **Nov 5:** ⭐ ROE released (14-day violation vs 5-day requirement = **$10k punitive in 2024 case**)

**⭐ Document Manipulation (3 events with stars):**
- Oct 30: ⭐ Carol Burke WRONG documents sent (Manulife forms instead of employment docs)
- Oct 31: Correction ignored for 24 hours
- **Nov 4:** ⭐ "Dear Rollins:" contract error revealed (potential void contract +$10k-$20k)

**Financial Bad Faith (3 events):**
- **Oct 27:** ⭐ Final pay to WRONG bank account (financial hardship when employee has no income)
- Oct 28: Employee coordinates correction of employer error (4-day timeline)
- Oct 23: Carol Burke stalling on document access

**Correspondence Pattern (3 events):**
- Oct 22: Employee exercises PIPA rights (requests employment file)
- Oct 24: Timecard access blocked
- Oct 29: Initial document request sets up 6-day delay

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Federal ROE Violation ($10k Punitive):**
- **Legal requirement:** ROE within 5 days of interruption (EI Act)
- **Employer:** 14 days (Oct 22 termination → Nov 5 release)
- **9-day violation** during critical EI application period
- **Impact:** Financial hardship, delayed benefits when employee most vulnerable
- **2024 Case Law:** ONSC 3452 awarded $10k punitive for similar ROE delay

**2. Catastrophic ROE Error:**
- Sept 11 ROE: 95%+ error rate (start date, hours, amounts all wrong)
- Would have destroyed EI parental benefits claim (~$16k+ lost)
- Filed during protected parental leave (bad faith timing)
- Corrected 8 days later (still has errors)

**3. Document Integrity Destroyed:**
- Oct 30: Wrong documents sent, correction ignored 24 hours
- Nov 4: "Dear Rollins:" contract error = potential void contract
- If contract void: Termination clause unenforceable (+$10k-$20k damages)
- Termination letter discrepancy (employee 75% confident original didn't list reasons)

**4. Financial Hardship Pattern:**
- Wrong bank account when employee has no income
- ROE delay prevents EI application
- Employment file withheld pending ROE (PIPA violation)
- Systematic obstruction when employee most vulnerable

### Settlement Value: $10k-$15k (punitive damages)
**If Contract Void:** +$10k-$20k (common law notice applies)

---

## FILTER 6: OHS RETALIATION (PATTERN EVIDENCE + COR LEVERAGE)

### Purpose
**NOT standalone claim** (3-month gap weakens direct causation). **USE AS:** Pattern evidence proving bad faith + COR certification leverage for settlement pressure.

### Legal Theory
**Pattern Evidence:**
- Employee advocates for safety → Employer retaliates → Employer quietly implements solution → Proves employee right
- Demonstrates: Technical competence, employer punitive behavior, consciousness of wrongdoing
- Undermines just cause narrative (employee improving workplace, not incompetent)

**COR Leverage (Settlement Pressure):**
- Certificate of Recognition = MANDATORY for oil & gas contracts
- Unreported workplace injury (July 20 - 3 workers) = COR Element 7 violation
- OHS investigation → COR Employer Review → potential suspension
- Business catastrophe: Cannot bid contracts (hundreds of thousands to millions lost)

### Event Count: 7 Events

**Advocacy + Vindication (3 events):**
- Jul 1-7, 2024: Hydraulic troubleshooting victory (employee correct, boss wrong, VP witnessed)
- Oct 1, 2024: Confined space safety meeting (sent home, employer later implemented exact procedures)
- Jun 3: $10k tank decontamination (proves hazards were real)

**⭐ Unreported Workplace Injury (1 event - SMOKING GUN):**
- **Jul 20, 2025:** ⭐ Epoxy paint tank injury - **3 WORKERS HURT, NO WCB REPORT**
  - Intense burning eyes, work stopped
  - Jul 22: Full face masks arrived within 1-2 days (exact PPE employee requested for year)
  - NO incident investigation (COR Element 7 violation)
  - Witness elimination: Employee terminated 3 months later

**Pattern Evidence (3 events):**
- May 9: Painting washbay inadequate ventilation (boss admits problem)
- Jul 14-31: Overtime marathon (OHS fatigue management, family status overlap)
- Oct 15, 2024: Write-Up #1 - Hydraulic headphones (OHS retaliation, pretextual discipline)

### Key Legal Arguments

**1. Advocacy-Retaliation-Vindication Pattern:**

**STEP 1 - ADVOCACY:**
- Hydraulic troubleshooting: Suggested correct fittings, boss ignored
- Confined space: Requested full face mask for debris protection
- Year-long advocacy for better PPE (documented in epoxy injury event)

**STEP 2 - RETALIATION:**
- Sent home from safety meeting for being "too passionate"
- Written warning for speaking up at VP meeting (hydraulic project)
- No credit when proven correct

**STEP 3 - VINDICATION:**
- Hydraulic: Boss bought exact fittings employee suggested (proven right)
- Confined space: Employer implemented procedures, rescue team after sending employee home
- Epoxy: Procured full face masks within 1-2 days AFTER 3 workers injured

**STEP 4 - PROVES EMPLOYEE RIGHT:**
- Employee technically competent (hydraulic victory in front of VP)
- Employer punitive (disciplines for being correct)
- Consciousness of wrongdoing (implements solutions without acknowledgment)

**2. Unreported Workplace Injury (COR Leverage):**
- July 20: 3 workers injured (burning eyes, work stopped)
- NO WCB report filed (violates reporting requirements)
- NO incident investigation (COR Element 7 violation)
- Likely PSI (Potentially Serious Incident) - chemical exposure in confined space
- Witness elimination: Employee terminated 3 months later (Oct 22)

**3. COR Settlement Pressure:**
- OHS investigation → COR Employer Review
- Unreported injury + no investigation + retaliation = COR suspension risk
- Business impact: Cannot bid oil & gas contracts
- Settlement cost ($30-50k) << COR investigation risk (millions + business-threatening)

### Settlement Value: Pattern evidence (supports bad faith) + COR leverage (settlement pressure)
**Not separate damages, but increases overall settlement by $5k-$10k due to COR risk**

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why are some events on multiple filters?**
A: 9 events appear on 2-3 filters because they support multiple legal theories. Example: "Overtime Marathon" supports family status (eliminated family time), OHS (fatigue management), and bad faith (created exhaustion they disciplined for).

**Q: Should I use all 7 filters in initial consultation?**
A: No. Start with Overview (5 min), then Family Status + Disability (15 min). Add others only if lawyer wants deeper dive or asks about specific issues.

**Q: What if lawyer questions the July 20 "family doesn't matter" statement?**
A: Direct quote from boss. Context: Employee worked 7 consecutive days (part of 18-day marathon), needed to care for infant + wife, boss demanded return at 6 PM Sunday to work until midnight. Employee contemplated returning (showing good faith), boss responded: "We are going to have a major talk tomorrow." Next day (July 21): Boss said "When we're in crunch time, I need you in the shop" and "It doesn't matter what happens at [home], you need to come in to work."

**Q: Why is OHS "pattern evidence" instead of standalone claim?**
A: 3-month gap between last OHS incident (July 20 epoxy injury) and termination (Oct 22) weakens direct causation for Discriminatory Adverse Consequence test. BUT pattern is STRONG: Employee right → Employer retaliates → Employer implements solution → Proves employee competent. Use to support bad faith and as COR settlement leverage (unreported injury = COR suspension risk).

**Q: What if employer claims "Dear Rollins:" was just a typo?**
A: Contract law: Typo in salutation addressing DIFFERENT PERSON raises "mistake in identity" defense (no meeting of minds). If contract void, termination clause doesn't apply, common law notice required instead of ESC minimum (+$10k-$20k damages). At minimum, destroys employer credibility on ALL documentation (if wrong name on contract, what about write-ups, timecards, termination reasons?).
