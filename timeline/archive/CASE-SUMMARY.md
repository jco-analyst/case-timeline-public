## The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

I was terminated for "just cause" (lateness) **12 DAYS** after returning from parental leave. My boss initially told me **"being late is okay, just let me know"** - and I complied perfectly for 9 months. Then, when I refused to work until midnight on a Sunday to care for my infant, he retaliated. He told me **"It doesn't matter what happens at [home], you need to come in to work"** and withdrew all accommodation. I also have ADHD and sleep apnea (both known, never accommodated), and was disciplined for raising legitimate safety concerns.

**NEW (November 2025):** The employer's lawyer sent me an employment contract addressed to **"Dear Rollins:"** - a completely different employee - and a termination letter that I'm 75% sure didn't list specific reasons when I received it 13 days earlier. This destroys their credibility on ALL documentation.

This is family status discrimination with proven accommodation withdrawal, disability discrimination, and wrongful dismissal - with OHS retaliation and document fabrication as evidence of bad faith.

## 🚨 MAJOR UPDATE: DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION DISCOVERED (October 27, 2025)

**Employee has TWO diagnosed disabilities:**
1. **ADHD** - Employer knew from day one (pre-employment drug test + doctor's note)
2. **Sleep Apnea (MODERATE)** - Employer knew from February 18, 2025 (doctor's letter provided)

**Boss (John) has BOTH same conditions:**
- Told employee he "understood the struggles" (ADHD)
- Also has sleep apnea - employee discussed with him

**NO accommodations offered despite employer's knowledge**

**REALISTIC ASSESSMENT:** Disability was contributing factor to lateness/timecard issues (not sole cause - family/childcare was primary). But employer's failure to accommodate known disabilities strengthens case and adds settlement pressure. Likely adds $5k-$15k to settlement value.

## The Claims - Multiple Protected Grounds (Updated November 9, 2025)

**NOTE:** Rankings updated based on 2024 Alberta case law research. Family status is #1 (recent cases show $25k-$40k, non-taxable), disability is #2 (boss has same conditions = destroys defense).

### 1. Family Status Discrimination (STRONGEST - $25k-$40k, NON-TAXABLE)

**🚨 NEW: Accommodation Withdrawal Pattern Discovered**

**Timeline:**
- **October 2024:** Baby born, boss says **"Being late is okay. Just let me know in advance"**
- **Oct 2024 - July 2025:** Boss accommodates for 9 months, no issues
- **July 20, 2025:** Employee refuses to work until midnight on Sunday (family boundary)
- **July 21, 2025:** Boss says **"It doesn't matter what happens at [home], you need to come in"** (SMOKING GUN)
- **After July 21:** Boss withdraws ALL accommodation, denies all requests
- **August 29:** Denies sick baby accommodation
- **September 4 - October 9:** Employee on parental leave (5 weeks)
- **October 10:** Returns to work
- **October 14-16:** Requires sick note (Jessica sick same week, none required)
- **October 20-21:** Denies schedule accommodation request
- **October 22:** Terminated - **12 DAYS** after parental leave, **1-2 days** after asserting family rights

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Boss admitted lateness was acceptable ("it's okay, just let me know")
- ✅ 9-month accommodation period proves no undue hardship
- ✅ Accommodation withdrawal immediately after July 20 boundary assertion
- ✅ Boss's explicit statement about family not mattering (text messages)
- ✅ Pattern of denied requests after July 20 (all documented)
- ✅ Wife's ADHD - employee handling 100% of childcare + cooking + cleaning (boss knew)
- ✅ Terminated 12 days after parental leave

**Why It's #1 (per 2024 Alberta case law research):**
- **Recent Alberta cases: $25k-$40k** (Silliker v Suncor 2024: $40k + wages, Bauknecht 2024: $35k + wages)
- **NON-TAXABLE damages** (~$12k tax savings vs. lost wages)
- **12-day timing = presumption of discrimination** under Alberta law
- Employer PROVED accommodation is possible (did it for 9 months)
- Clear turning point (July 20) proving retaliation
- Boss's explicit smoking gun statement + HR institutional discrimination
- 1-year limitation period creates employer urgency

---

### 2. Disability Discrimination (STRONG SECONDARY - $25k-$50k, NON-TAXABLE)

**Combined ADHD + Sleep Apnea Claim**
**Pattern:**
- **Confined Space Incident (~2024):** Raised safety concerns about tank work, requested full face mask PPE → Sent home from safety meeting → **Employer implemented confined space procedures AFTER** (proving you were right)
- **Hydraulic Lines Incident (Oct 2024):** Raised safety concerns about hydraulic fittings, researched safe methods → Written up for "headphones/aggressive behavior" while doing safety research
- **Epoxy Paint Incident (Aug 2025):** **THREE workers (including you) injured** with chemical eye burns painting tank → Work stopped due to intense pain → **Employer FINALLY provided full face masks you requested a year earlier**

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Employer's own actions VALIDATE your concerns (implemented procedures, provided PPE)
- ✅ Actual workplace injury occurred due to employer ignoring your request
- ✅ Sent home from safety meeting for raising concerns = clear retaliation
- ✅ Protected activity under Alberta OHS Act
- ✅ Pattern over a year showing repeated retaliation for safety advocacy

**Why This Is Equally Strongest:**
- **Employer proved your case FOR you** - by implementing procedures and providing PPE, they admitted you were right
- **Documented harm** - workers actually injured
- **Protected activity** - OHS Act prohibits disciplining for safety concerns
- **Clear causation** - disciplined FOR raising safety concerns (not mixed like disability)
- **Less ambiguous than other claims** - employer's validation is smoking gun

---

### 2. Disability Discrimination - Sleep Apnea (STRONG - Contributing Factor)
**Timeline:**
- **February 18, 2025:** Sleep apnea diagnosed (MODERATE severity), employee told boss and gave doctor's letter
- **Boss (John) has sleep apnea too** - employee discussed condition with him
- **April 2025:** Lateness pattern begins (2 months AFTER employer knew about disability)
- **April - October 2025:** 13 lateness incidents - ALL after employer knew about sleep apnea
- **NO accommodations offered:** No flexible start time, no grace period, nothing
- **October 22, 2025:** Terminated for lateness caused by MULTIPLE factors (family + disability)

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Doctor's letter dated February 18, 2025 (provided to employer)
- ✅ Sleep study results and CPAP prescription
- ✅ Boss has same disability - shows knowing failure to accommodate
- ✅ ALL lateness occurred AFTER employer knew
- ✅ ZERO accommodations offered

**Realistic Assessment:**
- Sleep apnea was CONTRIBUTING factor to lateness (not sole cause)
- Primary cause was childcare, but sleep apnea made it harder to wake on time
- Employer's failure to accommodate known disability strengthens overall case
- Boss having same condition shows knowing discrimination

---

### 3. Disability Discrimination - ADHD (MODERATE - Harder to Prove Causation)
**Timeline:**
- **January 2024:** ADHD disclosed at hiring (pre-employment drug test showed medication)
- **Employee provided doctor's note explaining ADHD medication**
- **Boss (John) has ADHD too** - told employee he "understood the struggles"
- **Fall 2024 onwards:** 4-6 timecard write-ups (ADHD affects executive function)
- **July/August 2025:** "Last chance" warning for timecards
- **October 22, 2025:** Terminated partly for timecard issues caused by KNOWN disability

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Drug test records showing amphetamines (employer has)
- ✅ Doctor's note explaining ADHD medication (provided at hiring)
- ✅ Boss's statement "I understand the struggles" (admission)
- ✅ Boss has ADHD himself
- ✅ ALL timecard discipline occurred AFTER employer knew
- ✅ ZERO accommodations (no reminders, no system modifications)

**Realistic Assessment:**
- ADHD CAN affect executive function (timecard completion)
- BUT: Employer's timecard system was confusing for everyone
- Harder to prove ADHD was primary cause vs. bad system
- Boss having ADHD himself is significant (shows knowledge)
- No accommodations offered (no reminders, no system changes)
- Worth including but causation harder to prove than sleep apnea

---

### 4. Wrongful Dismissal (STRONG)
**Just Cause Threshold Not Met:**
- Lateness caused by protected ground (family status)
- Inconsistent application (group chat shows others late without discipline)
- **Sick note required from employee (Oct 14-16), NOT required from Jessica same week** (text message proof)
- Progressive discipline was coercive (boss threatened termination 10+ times throughout employment)
- Signatures on write-ups obtained under duress
- Contradictory phone policies created impossible standard

**Entitlements if Just Cause Fails:**
- Statutory minimum: 2 weeks pay ($2,500)
- Common law reasonable notice: 2-4 months ($10,000-$25,000+)

---

### 5. Document Irregularities (NEW - November 2025) 🚨

**Status:** CRITICAL - Significantly strengthens case and increases settlement leverage

**Overview:** Employer's lawyer (Carol Burke) sent two documents on November 4, 2025 containing serious irregularities that may constitute evidence fabrication/alteration.

#### Issue #1: Employment Contract Addressed to Wrong Person (SMOKING GUN)

**The Error:**
- Contract header: "Jonathan Co, 228 Edgemont Estates Drive..."
- Contract salutation: **"Dear Rollins:"** (completely different employee)
- Jonathan's signature at bottom

**Legal Implications:**
1. **Contract may be VOID** (mistake in identity - no meeting of minds)
2. **If void, termination clause doesn't apply** → Common law notice (2-4 months = $10,833-$21,666 vs. ESC minimum 2 weeks = $2,500)
3. **Potential damages increase:** +$8,333-$19,166
4. **Destroys employer credibility** - If wrong name on contract, ALL their documents are suspect

#### Issue #2: Termination Letter Timing/Content Discrepancy

**The Facts:**
- **October 22:** Employee terminated, received letter, left it at workplace
- **John Gonzales said:** "You know what this is" (didn't verbally explain reasons)
- **Employee's 75% recollection:** Letter did NOT list specific reasons
- **November 4:** Carol Burke sends termination letter listing THREE specific reasons:
  1. Timecard failures
  2. Late on Oct 22
  3. Not following protocols

**Three Possible Scenarios:**
1. **Letter was revised after Oct 22** (reasons added post-hoc) → After-Acquired Cause Doctrine
2. **Same letter, employee's memory wrong** → Still bad faith ("you know what this is")
3. **Two versions exist** (gave employee generic, kept detailed version) → Spoliation

**Legal Implications:**
1. **If revised:** After-Acquired Cause = Bad faith damages ($10k-$30k)
2. **If same:** Bad faith communication = Still violates duty of good faith
3. **Can check PDF metadata** to determine creation date
4. **Employer has duty to preserve original** - if "lost" → Adverse inference

#### Combined Impact: Credibility Destruction

**Pattern of Unreliable Documentation:**
- ❌ Contract to wrong person ("Dear Rollins:")
- ❌ Termination letter discrepancy (timing/content)
- ❌ Email cut while reviewing documents
- ❌ Contract sent to revoked email

**Effect on Case:**
> "If this employer sent me someone else's contract and possibly altered my termination letter, how can we trust their write-ups, timecard records, or any other evidence? Their pattern of fabricated/unreliable documentation taints ALL evidence. They cannot meet their burden for just cause."

**Updated Settlement Value:**
- **Before document issues:** $17,500-$82,000
- **With document issues:** $35,833-$181,166
- **Realistic with COR leverage:** $40,000-$90,000
- **Settlement probability:** 85-90%

**Research Completed:**
- ✅ `docs/research/DOCUMENT-ALTERATION-RESEARCH.md` (38 pages, case law citations)
- ✅ `docs/correspondence/from-employer/CAROL-BURKE-NOV4-ANALYSIS.md` (25 pages, tactical analysis)

**Evidence Location:** `evidence/Doc from Carol/`

**Next Steps:**
1. Lawyer demands PDF metadata (check creation date)
2. Lawyer demands original Oct 22 termination letter
3. Lawyer demands explanation of "Dear Rollins:" contract
4. If employer refuses/can't produce → Spoliation claim

---

## Secondary Issues (Supporting Claims)

### Evidence Spoliation
- Work email access cut while actively reviewing documents (couple hours after termination)
- Employment contract sent to revoked email, employer claims "already provided"
- Employer stalling on document production despite PIPA obligations

### Poisoned Work Environment
- Boss threatened termination 10+ times for minor issues
- High turnover environment
- Boss micromanages, "always believes he is right"
- Pattern of intimidation making employees fear job loss

### Unreimbursed Business Expenses
- Required to use personal phone for: door access, safety inspections, 24/7 availability
- Employer refused reimbursement, claimed it was "in contract" (it wasn't)

## Questions for Employment Lawyer

### About Case Strategy:
1. Should we lead with family status discrimination? (This appears to be strongest claim - July 21 smoking gun, 12 days after parental leave)
2. How do we use the OHS retaliation pattern as evidence of bad faith and to undermine employer's credibility?
3. Is the 3-month timing gap between July epoxy incident and October termination too large for a standalone OHS Discriminatory Action Complaint?
4. Should we file human rights complaint in addition to wrongful dismissal?
5. What's realistic settlement range given multiple claims? (Family Status + Disability + Wrongful Dismissal with OHS pattern evidence)

### About Evidence:
6. Can we compel employer to restore work email access?
7. Should I file Privacy Commissioner complaint if they keep stalling on documents?
8. Do we need witness statements from coworkers now or later?
9. Should I try to get photos/documentation from workplace?

### About Final Wages & PTO:
13. Can employer deduct negative PTO balance from final pay if just cause fails?
14. Is PTO front-loading policy legal/enforceable in Alberta?
15. Should I dispute any PTO deduction from final wages?

### About Procedure:
9. What's timeline: demand letter → negotiation → litigation?
10. Do I have constructive dismissal argument in addition to wrongful dismissal?
11. Should I report to Alberta OHS before or after wrongful dismissal claim?
12. Any concerns about employer's lawyer (Carol Burke) already being involved?

## Red Flags to Emphasize with Lawyer

🚩 **Terminated < 2 months after parental leave** (family discrimination timing)
🚩 **Employer implemented confined space procedures AFTER sending me home for raising concerns** (proves I was right, they retaliated)
🚩 **Cut off email access WHILE I was reviewing documents** (spoliation)
🚩 **Sent employment contract to email they revoked, claim it's "provided"** (bad faith)
🚩 **Written up for staying home with sick child** (blatant family status issue)
🚩 **Boss threatened termination 10+ times** (coerced discipline, not legitimate progressive discipline)

---

## Core Message

**This isn't about lateness. This is about:**
1. An employee who raised legitimate safety concerns (proven by employer implementing his suggestions)
2. An employee who needed accommodation for a newborn baby
3. An employer who used "just cause" to avoid paying severance to someone they wanted gone

**Termination = Retaliation for protected activities (safety advocacy + family status)**
