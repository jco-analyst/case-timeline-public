Duration: UNDER 2 MINUTES from start to finish. Called into office with NO advance warning - ambush meeting. Employee sat down. Handed termination letter immediately. Boss: "You know what this is" (or similar). Employee read letter silently - no discussion, just reading. Saw "Termination with just cause" - heart sank. Saw "no severance will be given" - not even 2 weeks. Immediate realization: Very likely won\'t get EI, no severance (not even 2 weeks employee knew he was entitled to), "I need this money to pay rent and bills," complete financial panic. Employee in SHOCK - couldn\'t say anything. Employee asked: "Is there anything I need to sign?" Employer: "No." Employee left immediately - "Just up and left." Knew it was over. Employee\'s state: Complete shock, heart sank at "just cause," immediate understanding of devastating impact (no EI, no severance, can\'t pay rent/bills, financial crisis for family), paralyzed - couldn\'t speak/respond, felt cornered ("Anything I would have said wouldn\'t have helped"), knew it was predetermined, nothing would change outcome, knew it was over - no point saying anything, read silently - too shocked to speak or object.

Just cause threshold NOT MET: Lateness alone doesn\'t meet "destroy employment relationship" standard. ONE technical failure (phone died) ≠ fundamental breach. Inconsistent application (others late, no discipline). Family status discrimination (majority of lateness childcare-related, no accommodation offered). Disability discrimination (sleep apnea + ADHD known, no accommodation). SAME-DAY termination proves PRETEXT: No investigation, no hearing employee\'s side, disproportionate response, no final warning this incident would result in termination. Real reason timeline: Safety advocacy → Parental leave x2 → Family accommodations requested/denied → Oct 20-21 overtime pushback → Oct 22 pretext firing. ZERO procedural fairness: Ambush meeting (no warning), predetermined (letter ready), under 2 minutes total, no opportunity to respond/explain, employee in shock (paralyzed, felt cornered), boss: "You know what this is" (foregone conclusion), no discussion, just handed letter, employee read silently, heart sank, immediate financial panic, couldn\'t pay rent/bills, asked if anything to sign (no) and left, felt predetermined ("anything I said wouldn\'t have helped"), "I knew it was over." Supervised exit: Rushed, intimidating, forgot termination letter at workplace. "Last chance" warning does NOT justify this: (1) Oct 22 different circumstances (technical failure vs childcare), (2) No investigation, (3) No accommodation ever offered for family status, (4) Warning given under duress (10+ threats), (5) Same-day termination still disproportionate, (6) Protected ground not considered.

    legalSignificance: '🚨 JUST CAUSE DESTROYER 🚨 This smoking gun proves: (1) "Progressive discipline" was MANUFACTURED - boss controlled the problem (unlock access), (2) Employee TRIED to comply (requested unlock Oct 20), (3) Boss cited "continued failure" HE CREATED by delaying unlock, (4) 2-day timeline (Oct 20 unlock request → Oct 22 termination) proves termination was PREMEDITATED not performance-based, (5) Employer cannot claim "just cause" for problems EMPLOYER CAUSED through broken system + boss-controlled remedy. ALBERTA LAW: Just cause requires employee\'s conduct fundamentally destroy relationship. Here, EMPLOYER\'S CONDUCT (broken system + boss weaponizes unlock) destroyed relationship. This evidence DESTROYS just cause defense. Shows termination was predetermined outcome, progressive discipline was theater to build pretextual paper trail. Combined with: Write-up #1 OHS retaliation + Write-up #4 parental leave retaliation + Catch-22 system = ZERO legitimate just cause.',

Meanwhile, employee disciplined with progressive write-ups leading to termination for similar lateness (average 3-10 minutes). INSTANCES: (1) May 16: Boss missing morning meeting, (2) May 28: Boss late to work, (3) July 10: Boss not there for morning meeting, (4) July 22: Employee checks up on late boss (role reversal), (5) July 27: Boss late to work, (6) Aug 9: Boss late to work on SATURDAY. PROVES: Inconsistent application of attendance standards = discrimination. Boss has same timecard struggles (admitted during write-up #2), boss late frequently without write-ups, employee late with proactive communication and terminated. Cannot establish "just cause" when employer doesn\'t apply same standards to management. LEGAL SMOKING GUN: Same conduct (lateness) → Different treatment (boss no discipline, employee terminated) = DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT.
