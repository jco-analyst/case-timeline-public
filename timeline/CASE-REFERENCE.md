## 30-Second Pitch

Electrical technician (2 years, $65k/year) terminated Oct 22, 2025 for "just cause" (lateness) **12 days** after returning from parental leave. **STRONGEST CLAIM:** Family status discrimination - terminated for childcare lateness after boss said **"when we're in crunch time, I need you in the shop"** (July 21) and HR said **"having children should not be a reason why you're late"** (July/Aug). **Recent 2024 Alberta case law: $25k-$40k for similar facts, NON-TAXABLE.** Also disability discrimination (ADHD + sleep apnea, boss has same conditions, zero accommodation). Wrongful dismissal + bad faith (ROE delayed, email cut, "Dear Rollins:" contract error destroys credibility). Settlement range: **$50k-$75k** (consensus from case files + legal research).

## Strongest Claims (Priority Order)

**Based on: Case file analysis + 2024 Alberta case law research**

### 1. Family Status Discrimination (STRONGEST - $25k-$40k, NON-TAXABLE)
**What:** Terminated for childcare lateness 12 days after returning from 5-week parental leave. Boss withdrew 9 months of accommodation after employee asserted family boundary (July 20).

**Why It's #1:**
- **Recent Alberta cases (2024): $25k-$40k for similar facts** (Silliker v Suncor: $40k + wages, Bauknecht: $35k + wages)
- **NON-TAXABLE damages** (saves $7k-$12k in taxes vs. lost wages)
- **12-day timing = presumption of discrimination** under Alberta law
- **7 smoking guns** with direct evidence (not circumstantial)
- 1-year limitation period creates employer urgency

**Smoking Guns:**
- Boss (July 21): **"When we're in crunch time, I need you in the shop"**
- HR Michelle (July/Aug): **"Everyone here has had children and no one else is late. Having children should not be a reason"**
- Aug 28: Sick baby denied, doctor's note required
- Oct 10: Return from parental leave, Write-Up #4 issued SAME DAY (33-day delay proves retaliation)
- Oct 22: Terminated **12 days** after protected leave return

**Evidence:** Text messages, Michelle's statement, objective timeline, doctor's note

### 2. Disability Discrimination (STRONG SECONDARY - $25k-$50k, NON-TAXABLE)
**What:** Terminated for lateness/timecard issues related to TWO documented disabilities (ADHD + sleep apnea) with ZERO accommodation provided.

**Why It's #2:**
- **Recent Alberta case: $50k for ADHD + PTSD** (EZ Motors, Red Deer)
- **NON-TAXABLE damages** (huge tax advantage)
- **Boss has BOTH same conditions** (eliminates "undue hardship" defense)
- Employer had full knowledge (doctor's notes on file since day 1 for ADHD, Feb 2025 for sleep apnea)
- Disciplined for disability-related behaviors with no accommodation

**Strategic Value:**
- Hard for employer to defeat BOTH family status AND disability claims
- Creates alternative legal theory (if one fails, other may succeed)
- Increases settlement pressure (multiple protected grounds)

**Evidence:** Pre-employment drug test (ADHD medication), doctor's notes (both conditions), boss's admission "I understand the struggles"

### 3. Wrongful Dismissal + Bad Faith (FOUNDATION - $15k-$35k)
**What:** Just cause threshold not met (high bar in Alberta). Progressive discipline was coercive (10+ termination threats), inconsistent application, signed under duress.

**Damages Breakdown:**
- Wrongful dismissal: $10k-$15k (2-3 months notice, TAXABLE)
- Bad faith conduct: +$5k-$20k (Wallace damages, aggravating factors)

**Bad Faith Pattern:**
- ROE delayed 9-14 days (2024 case: $10k punitive for similar delay)
- Email access cut while reviewing documents (spoliation)
- 10+ termination threats throughout employment
- Differential sick note treatment (Jessica vs. employee, final week)

**Evidence:** Termination timing (12 days post-leave), ROE delay emails, email cutoff, differential treatment

### 4. Contract Error - Tactical Credibility Destroyer (LEVERAGE TOOL, not standalone claim)
**What:** Employment contract addressed to **"Dear Rollins:"** (wrong employee name).

**Strategic Use:**
- **Opens settlement negotiation:** "They can't even get my name right - how can we trust their evidence?"
- Undermines credibility of ALL employer documentation (write-ups, timecards, termination reasons)
- May void contract → termination clause doesn't apply (+$10k-$20k if proven)
- Creates lawyer embarrassment (Carol Burke sent the document)

**How to Use:**
- Lead with this to destroy employer credibility FIRST
- Then present family status + disability claims with full force
- But settle based on human rights damages value, not contract error alone

**Evidence:** PDF contract in `evidence/Doc from Carol/`, undeniable error visible

## Key Evidence (7 Smoking Guns)

1. **"Dear Rollins:" Contract** (Nov 4) - Wrong employee name, destroys credibility
2. **Boss "Crunch Time" Statement** (July 21) - Explicit rejection of family obligations
3. **HR "Everyone Has Kids" Statement** (July/Aug) - Head of HR discriminatory statement
4. **Aug 28 Sick Baby Denial** - Doctor's note required for childcare
5. **33-Day Delay Write-Up** (Oct 10) - Sept 7 email urgency → Oct 10 discipline (parental leave retaliation)
6. **12-Day Termination** (Oct 22) - 12 days after returning from protected parental leave
7. **Oct 20-22 Denial** - Employee requested accommodation, backed down, complied → terminated anyway

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Text messages (July 21, Aug 28, 13+ lateness notifications)
- Emails (Sept 7 Michelle, Nov 4 Carol Burke, Oct 24-28 Danielle, Nov 4-5 Michelle ROE)
- Medical records (ADHD, sleep apnea, sick child doctor's note)
- GPS Timeline data (proves minimal lateness, early arrival pattern June 25-Oct 22)
- Differential treatment (Jessica sick note, co-worker 5:30 PM accommodation)
- ROE errors (Aug/Sept parental leave + Nov termination, both delayed)

## Settlement Range

**Based on: 2024 Alberta case law + case file analysis**

**Conservative:** $40k-$50k (family + wrongful dismissal, quick settlement)
**Moderate:** $50k-$75k (family + disability + bad faith, supported by recent cases)
**Most Likely:** $55k-$70k (consensus from research + case strength)

**Breakdown by Claim:**
- Family status discrimination: $25k-$40k (NON-TAXABLE, 2024 Alberta cases)
- Disability discrimination: $25k-$50k (NON-TAXABLE, EZ Motors precedent)
- Wrongful dismissal: $10k-$15k (2-3 months notice, TAXABLE)
- Bad faith/Wallace damages: $5k-$20k (ROE delay, spoliation, threats)
- Contract error leverage: tactical tool (credibility destroyer, may add $10k-$20k if void)

**Tax Advantage:** $40k human rights damages (non-taxable) + $20k lost wages (taxable) = ~$12,000 tax savings vs. all lost wages

## Red Flags for Lawyer

🚨 **"Dear Rollins:" contract error** - Destroys ALL employer documentation credibility
🚨 **Terminated 12 days after parental leave** - Classic family status retaliation timing
🚨 **Two explicit discriminatory statements** - Boss + Head of HR (institutional discrimination)
🚨 **33-day delay discipline** - Sept 7 urgency → Oct 10 write-up (parental leave retaliation proof)
🚨 **Email access cut while reviewing documents** - Evidence spoliation
🚨 **ROE delayed 9-14 days** - Statutory violation (5-day requirement)
🚨 **HR participated in discrimination** - Michelle made discriminatory statement, no "rogue supervisor" defense
