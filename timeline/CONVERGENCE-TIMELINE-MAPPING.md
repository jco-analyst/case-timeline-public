## Critical Causal Chains for Legal Arguments

### Chain 1: FAMILY STATUS DISCRIMINATION
[71] → [1] → [76] → [22] → [73] → [74] → [28] → [33] → [34] → [35]

**Narrative**: Employer knew family was priority from interview → Accommodated for 9 months successfully → Withdrawal was retaliation → Systematic rejection of family obligations → Mandatory overtime without accommodation → Coerced acceptance of unreasonable demands → Terminated for conduct employer previously said was "okay"

### Chain 2: DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION
[2] → [9] → [75] → [27] → [34] → [35]

**Narrative**: ADHD disclosed day 1 → Sleep apnea diagnosed → Boss has same conditions but accommodated self (promotion) → Zero accommodations for employee → Timecard reminders prove systemic problem → Terminated for disability-related executive function issues → Boss escaped problem via promotion, employee fired for same struggle

### Chain 3: PARENTAL LEAVE RETALIATION
[77] → [36] → [60] → [61] → [65] → [30] → [35]

**Narrative**: Employee requests protected parental leave → Michelle sends "urgent" email with false deadline → Catastrophic ROE error during protected leave → Write-up on first day back (33-day delay) → Coercive environment with new hire → Lateness during childcare (legal obligation) → Terminated 12 days after return from protected leave

### Chain 4: OHS RETALIATION
[3] → [5] → [8] → [64] → [26] → [62] → [63] → [35]

**Narrative**: Employee challenges hydraulic project failure → Confined space safety advocacy → Disciplined for safety discussion → First write-up is OHS retaliation → 3 workers injured proving employee was right → $10k decontamination + ventilation issues confirmed → Witness eliminated via termination

### Chain 5: PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE INVALID
[64] → [8] → [4] → [24] → [65] → [78]

**Narrative**: Write-up #1 is pretextual OHS retaliation → Write-up #2 during timecard struggles (system broken) → Boss threatens wage theft to intimidate → "Last Chance" under duress during exhaustion → Write-up #4 after 33-day delay (parental leave retaliation) → All write-ups signed under coercive environment → Entire discipline chain invalid

### Chain 6: DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT = DISCRIMINATION
[39] → [40] → [42] → [43] → [44] → [45] → [67]

**Narrative**: Boss late May 16 → Boss late May 28 → Boss late July 10 → Boss late July 27 → Boss late Aug 9 → RJ/Ramon late Oct 16 no discipline → RJ late Oct 22 same as employee termination → 6+ instances of others' lateness without discipline vs employee terminated → Proves employer CAN tolerate lateness (tolerates boss) but selectively disciplines employee based on protected grounds

### Chain 7: TIMECARD CATCH-22 = MANIPULATION
[4] → [75] → [37] → [66] → [34] → [35]

**Narrative**: First write-up for timecard issues → 4 reminders in 52 days proving system broken + ongoing problem → Oct 20 employee requests unlock (trying to comply) → Boss controls access to compliance tool → Oct 22 terminates for "continued failure" HE CAUSED → Just cause destroyed by employer-created catch-22

### Chain 8: POST-TERMINATION BAD FAITH
[35] → [79] → [47] → [53] → [50] → [52]

**Narrative**: Termination Oct 22 → Email access cut during evidence gathering (spoliation) → Final pay sent to wrong account → ROE delayed 9 days (federal violation) → Wrong documents sent Oct 30 → Corrected with credibility-destroying errors Nov 4 → Pattern of systematic bad faith

- **Event 36** - False urgency email with 33-day delay (parental leave retaliation premeditation)
- **Event 37** - Timecard unlock catch-22 (system manipulation)

### Track 3 Smoking Guns:
- **Event 45** - RJ late SAME DAY as employee termination (ultimate differential treatment)
- **Event 35** - Same-day termination without investigation (pretext obvious)
- **Event 52** - Document tampering concerns ("Dear Rollins:" error)
- **Event 53** - ROE delayed 9 days (federal violation)
